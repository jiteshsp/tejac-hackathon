 *  Demostrate neighbor detection in deparate processes

Assumption:
There are 6 processes which are runnung parallely.
each has its own neighbor info stored in a file A,B,C... till F respectively.

To Run the Demo.
Open 6 terminals and run the below programs in each window respectively.

./s A
./s B
./s C
./s D
./s E
./s F

the processes will communicate with each other and display their calculated adjacency tables.
